# Codeforces CP Tracker

This is my **third day learning web development** and my **first day working with backend** technologies.  
Iâ€™ve built this simple app to track solved problems on Codeforces using their public API.

**Note:** ChatGPT was heavily used to understand concepts, write code, and guide me through the process.  
This project is a practical step in my learning journey and a foundation for more advanced web development skills.
